# i-have-a-bitcoin-app
This is the first app I built to start learning Swift and how to use Storyboard.

It's sort of a copy of the original "I'm Rich" app from many years ago. It only has a simple image view and some labels, just so I got used on how
to use assets and add stuff to the application itself.

I developed it as part of a Swift course I've enrolled into.
